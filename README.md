# Passlite

Passlite is a browser addon, which is a **fork** of the [Passbolt](https://github.com/passbolt/passbolt_browser_extension) browser addon.

The goal is to have an addon, which is more suitable for a managed (corporate) environment,
in which users do not create and manage passwords by themselves, but rather just use whatever is shared with them.

The following changes have been made compared to the original Passbolt addon:

- logos and names have been changed to prevent confusion with the original Passbolt addon. We'd like to credit Passbolt immensely for the great work that they've done, but we don't want to detract from their brand or cause confusion. Passlite is mostly compatible, but it's not Passbolt.

- some filtering features (by group, Favorites, etc.) have been removed to simplify the UI. Only the "Shared with me" filter has been preserved.

- "create new password" and "copy password" functionality has been removed

- a `X-Passlite: 1` HTTP header is sent during initial `/auth/verify.json` setup requests to signify that it's the Passlite fork that is making the request. It's up to the server to make or not make use of this header.

- a `Makefile` has been added, to make it simpler to publish source code

This addon can work with the original and default [Passbolt API server](https://github.com/passbolt/passbolt_api).

The original Passbolt README follows below.

You will need to install a plugin, you can find a step by step guide in the website
[help section](https://www.passbolt.com/help/start/firefox)

Or, of course, you can use the code in this repository to build it yourself and run it!

## About passbolt browser extension

A browser extension is needed to maintain a higher level of security, e.g. to ensure the integrity of the
cryptographic code and provide a secure random number generator. In the future it will also be used to provide feature such as
auto filling your passwords when visiting known websites.

# Quick how-to for developers

This is just a quick getting started guide, for more information and productivity tips checkout CONTRIBUTING.md

## Prerequisite

You will need ```node```, ```grunt``` and the dependencies listed in ```packages.json```.
```
git clone git@github.com:passbolt/passbolt_browser_extension.git
cd passbolt_browser_extension
npm install
```

For convenience you can also install ```web-ext``` (for firefox), ```crx``` (for chrome) globally,
otherwise can can be found in ```node_modules```.
```
sudo npm install web-ext -g
sudo npm install crx -g
```

## Quick bundling the build/all source

The non-minified source code is located in ```/src```. It can be 'bundled' ```to build/all``` as follow:
```
grunt
```

In order to rebuild the code in this directory automatically while you are editing the src
you can use the grunt watch task:
```
grunt watch
```

## Test a local version of the plugin
### Firefox

To launch an instance of Firefox with your local version of the add-on installed.
```
cd build/all
web-ext run
```

This instance will be reloaded everytime there is a change in the /build/all code or by pressing the ```r```
key on the keyboard when web-ext is running.
You can debug the application script by opening the
[browser console](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Tools/Browser_Console).

### Chrome

Go to the the extension page at [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) click on the
'load unpacked extension' button. Point to your build/all directory and you are good to go.
You debug the application script by clicking on index.html in "inspect views".

## Packaging the application

You can build the crx or xpi (zip) packages using the following command.
```
grunt build
```
The build can be found under ```dist/chrome``` or ```dist/firefox```.

## Updating the vendors or the styleguide

You can update the vendors or the styleguide in the ```package.json``` and run the copy task
in grunt to deploy them in the appropriate places. Check the ```Gruntfile.js```
for more information.
```
npm update
grunt copy:vendors
grunt copy:styleguide
```
The build can be found under ```dist/chrome``` or ```dist/firefox```.
